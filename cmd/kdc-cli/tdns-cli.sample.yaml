# Sample configuration file for kdc-cli
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a sample configuration file. All apiserver configurations
# for different TDNS CLI tools (kdc-cli, krs-cli, etc.) are intended to be
# merged into a single tdns-cli.yaml file. That is, the configuration for
# accessing tdns-kdc and the configuration for accessing tdns-krs should be
# placed next to each other in the same file, as shown in the example below.
#
# Copy this file to /etc/tdns/tdns-cli.yaml (or your preferred location) and
# customize it for your environment. You can also merge entries from other
# CLI tool sample configs into this file.
